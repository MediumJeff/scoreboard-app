This app is designed to provide a workable scoreboard for a sporting event. At the moment it is in a "proof of concept" stage. The components function properly on the page. Ultimately I would like to have it project a copy of the score data that could be sent to a second monitor with only the information the spectators would need. On another window would be the controls, visible to whomever is running the scoreboard for the event.

In its fininshed form it would work as follows:
<ul>
  <li>Home screen: user picks the sport the scoreboard is being used for (football, basketball, hockey, soccer, baseball, etc.)</li>
  <li>Settings: Based on the sport chosen, a form comes up to allow the user to set certain parameters for the event (Team names, length of period, number of periods, etc.)</li>
  <li>Display and Control windows: App opens a display window for spectator information and a control window for the operator.</li>
  <li>In-game adjustments: Control window can control score, time start and stop, period number. It would also be able to be adjusted should there be a timing or scoring error during the game. Player and penalty timers for hockey.</li>
  <li>Sound: Buzzer at the end of the period and playable when needed (substitutions, reviews, etc.). Add customizable sounds for home team score or other in-game events.</li>
  <li>Add-ons/possibilities: Game history storage, "ticker" type display across bottom of display window, player and scoring detail on scoreboard (basketball), team logos and backgrounds, and anything else that pops into my head.</li>
</ul>

At the moment the app is created with React components and CSS styling.
